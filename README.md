## Usage

[Complete Demo Code](https://github.com/pseudoankit/coachmark/blob/master/coachmark/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/pseudoankit/coachmark/demo/UnifyCoachmarkDemo.kt)

Define key for all composables that needs to be higlighted.
```kotlin
enum class Keys { Text1, Text2 }
```

At the root level, ensure that your code is wrapped with UnifyCoachmark.
```kotlin
UnifyCoachmark(
    tooltip = { /*@Deprecated since v2.0.4,  pass tooltip while calling `enableCoachMark` method*/ },
    overlayEffect = DimOverlayEffect(Color.Black.copy(alpha = .5f)),
    onOverlayClicked = { OverlayClickEvent.GoNext }
) { this : CoachmarkScope
    Content()     // Source code below ⏬
}
```

Call the enableCoachMark method in all the composables that need to be highlighted. 
<br>This method can be invoked within the CoachmarkScope. 
<br>If you are not in the CoachmarkScope, you can access it by calling LocalCoachMarkScope.current.
```kotlin
@Composable
private fun Content() {
    Text(
        text = "Will show tooltip 1",
        modifier = Modifier
            .enableCoachMark(
                key = Keys.Text1,    // unique key that we declared above
                toolTipPlacement = ToolTipPlacement.Top,
                highlightedViewConfig = HighlightedViewConfig(
                    shape = HighlightedViewConfig.Shape.Rect(12.dp),
                    padding = PaddingValues(8.dp)
                ),
                tooltip = {
                    Balloon(arrow = Arrow.Start()) {
                        Text(
                            text = "Highlighting Text1",
                        )
                    }
                },
                coachMarkScope = LocalCoachMarkScope.current  // not needed if you are already in CoachmarkScope
            )
    )
}
```
